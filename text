Recommendation Letter
To Whom It May Concern,
I am pleased to have the opportunity to provide a reference for ZONG-HUA, Wu and I highly
recommend him to study at National Cheng Kung University. I am ZONG-HUA's line manager,
so I can take the chance to closely observe his work performance, and evaluate his
interpersonal skills and his attitudes toward future. As a whole, ZONG-HUA is indeed an
outstanding colleague in all respects, and I will list out my understanding to him in the
following paragraphs.

ZONG-HUA was employed as a software engineer with our company. Although ZONG-HUA has worked 
 in information technology-related field, I still can observe that he has
strong passion for finance technology. After he accumulated many years of work experiences, 
he definitely can get a handle on system development. ZONG-HUA frequently does multi-dimension thinking
and engages in discussion with senior colleagues to improve himself and learn new
technique. He has shown a strong sense of responsibility, and has completed assigned
tasks on time. He is going to take on "DevOps" project and explore the application of 
artificial intelligence in the financial industry. It is a great opportunity for him to take 
advanced studies at NCKU and contribute his learned knowledge to work.

In conclusion, ZONG-HUA's hard work and my understanding to him suggest that he has
the potential and willingness to study as well as his characteristics of enthusiasm and
engagement. I would therefore highly recommend ZONG-HUA. Thank you for giving me an
opportunity to introduce such a special, distinguished and outstanding colleague.

If I can be of any further assistance, or provide you with any further information,
please do not hesitate to contact me.
