Recommendation Letter
To Whom It May Concern,
I am pleased to have the opportunity to provide a reference for Jing, Ye and I hly
recommend her to study at National Cheng Kung University. I am Jing's line manager,
so I can take the chance to closely observe her work performance, and evaluate her
interpersonal skills and her attitudes toward future. As a whole, Jing is indeed an
outstanding colleague in all respects, and I will list out my understanding to her in the
following paragraphs.
Jing was employed as a software engineer with our company. Although Jing did
not graduate from information technology-related field, I still can observe that she has
strong passion for finance technology. After she completed two projects, she definitely
can get a handle on system development. Jing frequently does multi-dimension thinking
and engages in discussion with senior colleagues to improve herself and learn new
technique. She has shown a strong sense of responsibility, and has completed assigned
tasks on time. Jing is going to take on automated testing project and the application of
AI on data security project. It is a great opportunity for her to take advanced studies at
NCKU and contribute the learned knowledge to work.
In conclusion, Jing's hard work and my understanding to her suggest that she has
the potential and willingness to study as well as her characteristics of enthusiasm and
engagement. I would therefore highly recommend Jing. Thank you for giving me an
opportunity to introduce such a special, distinguished and outstanding colleague.
If I can be of any further assistance, or provide you with any further information,
please do not hesitate to contact me.
